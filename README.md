## My Task

<br>This week I was tasked in creating a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions powered by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

<br>

## User Story

<br>AS A coding bootcamp student

I WANT to build a quiz app that will have a clean, responsive UI

SO THAT I can familiarize myself in completing a coding assessment as it is a possibility I will run into them in future job interviews

<br>

## Employer User Story
<br>

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to to take a timed quiz on JavaScript
fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers 
```
<br>

## Application

<br>The following animation shows the application's appearance and functionality:<br><br>

<br><br>

## What I Accomplished 

<br>

* Page loads with a prompt and start button for the quiz along with the timer and and a button linking to the high scores page.
<br>

* When the start button is clicked the timer begins and is presented with the first question
<br>

* When the user pressed their answer then they are presented with th next question
<br>

* When an answer to a question is incorrect there is a 20 second deduction to the timer

* When the timer reaches 0 or if all the questions are answered then the game is over.

* Once the game is over the user is presented their score and a text box to enter their initials to save to the high score page
